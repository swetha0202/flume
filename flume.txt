Flume Agent : 

Flume Agent is an independent Demon process in Flume,it recieves the data from clients or other Flume Agent and forwards it to next destinaton.

A Flume can have more than one agent

Basically Flume Agent  Contains 3 COmponents 

1.Source 

2.Channel

3.Sink


'Source' : Source is component of FA which recieves the data from data generators and forward to one or more Channels inthe form of Flume Events
    --> Source dont have any storage types
    --> Source send event to the channel to which source is connected
############################# Supported Sources by flume ###################

Spol directory ----> The spooling directory source is given a directory to watch for new files to appear. It is assumed that files copied to this directory are complete; 


Avro   -- > AvroSource
netcat --> NetcatSource
seq    --> SequenceGenratorSource
exec   --> ExecSource 
syslogtcp --> SyslogTcp
syslogudp --> SyslogUDPSource
Thrift    --> ThriftLegacySource

Channel : A channel is transient store which recieves the events from the source and buffers them untill they are consumed by sinks.it acts a bridge between source and sinks
           --> Once flume Source sends events to channel,it stores in channel.
	   ---> Channel is passive storage,it keeps the event untill the event is consumed by event 
		sink.

   3 types of channel   --> 
Memory channel:  Stores event in-memory queue from there event is access by sink.
		 Drawback --> if any software/hardware failes 
				if agent process die in the middle

File channel:  it is backed by local file system,unlike memory channel,file channel writes to the
disk,the file will be deleted ,after it accessed by sink.

Spillable Channel (not in production) : first it writes to the memory ,if the buffer size of memory is filled ,it splits to the local disk.	

File channel,Spillable Channel
these channels are fully transactional and they can work with many sources and sinks.
   Ex: JDBC Channel,File System Channel,Memory Channel


##########################################################################

Sink:
Sink removes the event from the channel and put it into on external repository like hdfs or towards to flume source of next flume agent in the flow.

Source and sink within given agent run asynchronously with events staged in the channel,they dont wait for each other.
There are many types of sinks 

HDFS sink
Logger sink
File roll sink
Hbase sink
Morphline sink
Elasticsearch sink
Avro Sink
